<h2>Salt documentation</h2>
<p>As part of my job working at <a class="reference external" href="http://saltstack.com">SaltStack</a> I often am
called upon to add to or update our extensive <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.saltstack.com">Salt documentation</a>. Just like our code, we like to keep each line of
our documentation to less than 80 characters. This helps with readability of
the source of our docs. When creating new docs, it’s not too hard to hit return
to start a new line, but often when modifying existing docs it is a pain to
redo lines and move the hard returns around to make the paragraphs look just
right. Quite often I would end up with paragraphs that look like the image
below which was a screenshot of the source of this very blog post while I was
initially writing it.</p>

<p>One day while I was working on our SaltStack training manual and was spending a
lot of time trying to get the paragraphs to not look too horrible I had the
brilliant idea to ask my coworker Seth House if he knew a vim command to help
with this problem. Being the vim master that he is, Seth sagely looked up and
said, “gqap”</p>
<p>Bam!!</p>
<p>Perfectly laid out paragraphs every time. Just look at the final result after
executing “gqap” on each paragraph.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="http://utahdave.github.io/blog/html/_images/Screenshot-gqap-after.png"><img alt="After Vim" src="http://utahdave.github.io/blog/html/_images/Screenshot-gqap-after.png" style="width: 819.6px; height: 460.8px;"/></a>
<p>Thanks, Seth!!</p>
